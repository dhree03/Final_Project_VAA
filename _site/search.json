    "text": "Happiness is a key measure of societal well-being, influenced by both economic (e.g., GDP per capita) and non-economic factors (e.g., social support, freedom, and governance). However, understanding how these factors interact remains a challenge.\nThis project aims to analyze the strongest predictors of happiness using data from the World Happiness Report and develop an interactive visualization tool to explore these relationships. By making happiness data more accessible and insightful, this study supports evidence-based decision-making for policymakers and researchers seeking to enhance well-being worldwide."

    "text": "4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nEDA is the first step in understanding the structure and patterns within the World Happiness Report dataset. The primary objectives of EDA in this project include:\nDescriptive Statistics: Summarizing key variables such as Happiness Score, GDP per Capita, Social Support, and Life Expectancy to understand their distribution and central tendencies\n-   **Missing Values**\n\n    -   3 missing values in **GDP per capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom to Make Life Choices, Generosity, Perceptions of Corruption, and Dystopia + Residual**.\n\n    -   No missing values in **Country Name and Ladder Score**\n\n-   **Summary Statistics**\n\n    -   **Ladder Score (Happiness Index)** ranges from **1.72** (least happy) to **7.74** (most happy), with an average of **5.53**.\n\n    -   **Log GDP per capita** varies from **0.00** to **2.14**, implying diverse economies.\n\n    -   **Social Support** has a strong influence, ranging from **0.00** to **1.61**.\n\n    -   **Freedom to Make Life Choices** ranges from **0.00** to **0.86**, showing variation in personal freedoms.\n\n    -   **Generosity & Perceptions of Corruption** have small values, indicating low levels of trust in many countries.\n\nUnivariate & Bivariate Visualizations:\n\nHistograms & Density Plots – Distribution of Happiness Scores\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics('plots/density-plots1.png')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics('plots/density-plots2.png')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insights from Distributions: Ladder Score (Happiness Index):\n\nPeaks around 5-6, meaning most countries fall within this range. Left-skewed, indicating some countries have very low happiness scores. GDP per Capita & Social Support:\nFollows a normal distribution, with most values around 1.0 - 1.5 for GDP. Social support has a strong right tail, meaning some countries have very high support. Freedom to Make Life Choices & Generosity:\nFreedom has a broad distribution but peaks around 0.6 - 0.7. Generosity is skewed left, meaning most values are quite low. Perceptions of Corruption:\nHighly skewed left, showing many countries perceive corruption as a major issue.\nBoxplots – Comparison of happiness scores across regions\n\n\nhappiness_data &lt;- read_excel(file_path) %&gt;% clean_names()  # Clean column names\n\n# Generate a Boxplot for Happiness Scores across Years\nggplot(happiness_data, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = life_ladder)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") + \n  labs(title = \"Happiness Score Distribution by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Happiness Score (Life Ladder)\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Generate a Boxplot for GDP per Capita across Years\nggplot(happiness_data, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = log_gdp_per_capita)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgreen\", color = \"black\") + \n  labs(title = \"GDP per Capita Distribution by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Log GDP per Capita\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Generate a Boxplot for Social Support across Years\nggplot(happiness_data, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = social_support)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightcoral\", color = \"black\") + \n  labs(title = \"Social Support Distribution by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Social Support\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis\nTo identify which factors have the strongest relationship with happiness.\no   *Measure the Strength of Relationships* – Identify which factors (GDP per capita, social support, freedom, generosity, corruption perception, etc.) have the strongest positive or negative correlation with happiness.\n\no   *Detect Key Influencers* – Determine whether economic factors (e.g., GDP per capita) or social indicators (e.g., social support, freedom) have a greater impact on happiness.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('plots/correlation-heatmap.png')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Insights:\nHappiness (Ladder Score) has the strongest correlations with:\n\nSocial Support (0.81) → Countries with stronger support systems are generally happier. GDP per Capita (0.77) → Wealthier countries tend to be happier. Healthy Life Expectancy (0.76) → Better health leads to higher happiness. Weak or Negative Correlations:\nGenerosity (0.13) and Perceptions of Corruption (0.45) have low influence on happiness. Dystopia + Residual (0.53) captures unexplained variance, slightly correlated.\nGeospatial Analysis:\n\nMapping happiness scores across countries to highlight global patterns\no   *Identify Global Happiness Trends* – Highlight regions with consistently high or low happiness levels, revealing geographical clusters of well-being.\n\no   *Compare Regional Differences* – Examine how happiness varies across continents and correlate findings with economic, social, and governance factors."

    "text": "4.2 Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)\nRegression Analysis: Objective: Identify the strongest predictors of happiness by modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (Happiness Score/Life Ladder) and independent variables (e.g., GDP per capita, social support, freedom, corruption perception, etc.).\nMethod: Use Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to quantify the impact of each factor on happiness scores. Perform Stepwise Regression to refine the model and select only the most significant predictors. Check for multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to ensure predictor variables are independent.\nOutcome: A predictive model that explains which factors contribute the most to national happiness.\nFeature Importance Analysis: Objective: Understand which variables influence happiness the most when applying non-linear models.\nMethod:\nTrain Random Forest Regression and compute feature importance scores. Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret how each feature contributes to happiness. Compare machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.) to check if non-linear relationships exist.\nOutcome: A ranked list of happiness predictors, identifying both strong contributors and lesser influential factors.\nClustering Analysis: Objective: Group countries based on similarities in happiness determinants to uncover hidden patterns.\nMethod:\nUse K-Means Clustering to categorize countries into groups based on economic, social, and governance factors. Apply Hierarchical Clustering to visualize the relationships between similar countries. Perform PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality and highlight key differences.\nOutcome: Clusters of countries with similar happiness profiles, allowing for comparative regional analysis.\nLongitudinal Analysis: Objective: Examine how happiness scores evolve over time and assess the impact of global events (e.g., economic crises, political shifts, COVID-19 pandemic).\nMethod:\nUse Trend Analysis with LOESS Smoothing to visualize long-term patterns. Apply ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or Exponential Smoothing to forecast future happiness trends. Conduct Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) to measure the impact of specific events on happiness scores.\nOutcome: Insights into how happiness levels have changed across different periods and predictions for future trends."
