    "text": "4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nEDA is the first step in understanding the structure and patterns within the World Happiness Report dataset. The primary objectives of EDA in this project include:\nDescriptive Statistics: Summarizing key variables such as Happiness Score, GDP per Capita, Social Support, and Life Expectancy to understand their distribution and central tendencies\n-   **Missing Values**\n\n    -   3 missing values in **GDP per capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom to Make Life Choices, Generosity, Perceptions of Corruption, and Dystopia + Residual**.\n\n    -   No missing values in **Country Name and Ladder Score**\n\n-   **Summary Statistics**\n\n    -   **Ladder Score (Happiness Index)** ranges from **1.72** (least happy) to **7.74** (most happy), with an average of **5.53**.\n\n    -   **Log GDP per capita** varies from **0.00** to **2.14**, implying diverse economies.\n\n    -   **Social Support** has a strong influence, ranging from **0.00** to **1.61**.\n\n    -   **Freedom to Make Life Choices** ranges from **0.00** to **0.86**, showing variation in personal freedoms.\n\n    -   **Generosity & Perceptions of Corruption** have small values, indicating low levels of trust in many countries.\n\nUnivariate & Bivariate Visualizations:\n\nHistograms & Density Plots – Distribution of Happiness Scores\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics('plots/density-plots1.png')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics('plots/density-plots2.png')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insights from Distributions: Ladder Score (Happiness Index):\n\nPeaks around 5-6, meaning most countries fall within this range. Left-skewed, indicating some countries have very low happiness scores. GDP per Capita & Social Support:\nFollows a normal distribution, with most values around 1.0 - 1.5 for GDP. Social support has a strong right tail, meaning some countries have very high support. Freedom to Make Life Choices & Generosity:\nFreedom has a broad distribution but peaks around 0.6 - 0.7. Generosity is skewed left, meaning most values are quite low. Perceptions of Corruption:\nHighly skewed left, showing many countries perceive corruption as a major issue.\nBoxplots – Comparison of happiness scores across regions\n\n\nhappiness_data &lt;- read_excel(file_path) %&gt;% clean_names()  # Clean column names\n\n# Generate a Boxplot for Happiness Scores across Years\nggplot(happiness_data, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = life_ladder)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") + \n  labs(title = \"Happiness Score Distribution by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Happiness Score (Life Ladder)\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Generate a Boxplot for GDP per Capita across Years\nggplot(happiness_data, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = log_gdp_per_capita)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgreen\", color = \"black\") + \n  labs(title = \"GDP per Capita Distribution by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Log GDP per Capita\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Generate a Boxplot for Social Support across Years\nggplot(happiness_data, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = social_support)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightcoral\", color = \"black\") + \n  labs(title = \"Social Support Distribution by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Social Support\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis\nTo identify which factors have the strongest relationship with happiness.\no   *Measure the Strength of Relationships* – Identify which factors (GDP per capita, social support, freedom, generosity, corruption perception, etc.) have the strongest positive or negative correlation with happiness.\n\no   *Detect Key Influencers* – Determine whether economic factors (e.g., GDP per capita) or social indicators (e.g., social support, freedom) have a greater impact on happiness.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('plots/correlation-heatmap.png')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Insights:\nHappiness (Ladder Score) has the strongest correlations with:\n\nSocial Support (0.81) → Countries with stronger support systems are generally happier.

    "text": "4.2 Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)\nRegression Analysis: Objective: Identify the strongest predictors of happiness by modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (Happiness Score/Life Ladder) and independent variables (e.g., GDP per capita, social support, freedom, corruption perception, etc.).\nMethod: Use Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to quantify the impact of each factor on happiness scores. Perform Stepwise Regression to refine the model and select only the most significant predictors. Check for multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to ensure predictor variables are independent.\nOutcome: A predictive model that explains which factors contribute the most to national happiness.\nFeature Importance Analysis: Objective: Understand which variables influence happiness the most when applying non-linear models.\nMethod:\nTrain Random Forest Regression and compute feature importance scores. Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret how each feature contributes to happiness. Compare machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.) to check if non-linear relationships exist.\nOutcome: A ranked list of happiness predictors, identifying both strong contributors and lesser influential factors.\nClustering Analysis: Objective: Group countries based on similarities in happiness determinants to uncover hidden patterns.\nMethod:\nUse K-Means Clustering to categorize countries into groups based on economic, social, and governance factors. Apply Hierarchical Clustering to visualize the relationships between similar countries. Perform PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality and highlight key differences.\nOutcome: Clusters of countries with similar happiness profiles, allowing for comparative regional analysis.\nLongitudinal Analysis: Objective: Examine how happiness scores evolve over time and assess the impact of global events (e.g., economic crises, political shifts, COVID-19 pandemic).\nMethod:\nUse Trend Analysis with LOESS Smoothing to visualize long-term patterns. Apply ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or Exponential Smoothing to forecast future happiness trends. Conduct Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) to measure the impact of specific events on happiness scores.\nOutcome: Insights into how happiness levels have changed across different periods and predictions for future trends."

    "section": "3.1 Discussion on Proposed Topics:",
    "text": "3.1 Discussion on Proposed Topics:\n\n3.1.1 Evaluation of the financial transactions and fraud detection dataset\nDhreeti suggested analyzing financial transactions and fraud detection using a dataset available on Kaggle. She noted that this dataset is well-suited for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling techniques such as classification and anomaly detection. The dataset included various transaction types, timestamps, and fraud indicators, making it a compelling choice for understanding financial fraud patterns.\nGood:\n\nContained diverse transaction types and timestamps.\nSuitable for predictive modeling and anomaly detection.\nCould provide insights into fraud trends and detection patterns.\n\nBad:\n\nData credibility concerns due to the confidential nature of financial transactions.\nLack of transparency in data sourcing and potential synthetic data issues.\nLimited time period (Total: 8 years), reducing the ability to analyze long-term trends.\nNarrow scope for exploratory data analysis beyond anomaly detection. There may or may not be any anomaly in the dataset.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Evaluation of the World Happiness Report (WHR) dataset\nAndrea introduced the idea of analyzing global happiness trends using data from the World Happiness Report (WHR). The dataset includes economic, social, and governance-related factors that contribute to national well-being. This dataset spans from 2008 to 2014 and is released as an annual report. It provides an opportunity to explore how happiness levels change year over year for different countries and identify patterns over time. By examining key contributing factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption, this dataset allows for an in-depth analysis of what influences a country’s happiness score. It will be particularly interesting to visualize trends across different regions and observe how certain global or national events impact overall happiness.\nGood:\n\nCovers at least 16 years of data (2008-2024), enabling trend analysis.\nProvides a mix of economic, social, and governance factors, allowing for a multi-dimensional exploration of happiness.\nOpen-source and publicly available, ensuring data credibility.\nAllows for geographic and time-series visualizations.\nPotential for interactive dashboards to explore how different factors influence happiness across countries and over time.\n\nBad:\n\nSome variables may have missing values, requiring data cleaning and imputation.\nLimited number of happiness-related factors (total of 8), which may restrict deeper analysis on additional influences beyond those included.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Evaluation of the Tourism dataset\nYi Ming suggested analyzing tourism trends using a dataset from the Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS). This dataset contains data on visitor arrivals on a month-to-month basis across countries, hotel occupancy rates, and available room nights. It is suited for seasonal forecasting, trend analysis, and geographic visualization, making it a strong candidate for exploring tourism behavior and economic impact.\nGood:\n\nProvides structured data on international visitor arrivals, hotel occupancy, and tourism trends over time.\nSuitable for seasonal trend analysis and forecasting.\nAllows for geographic and time-series visualizations.\n\nBad:\n\nPrimarily focused on tourism volume without deeper insights into traveler behavior and spending.\nExtensive existing research on tourism spending, making the analysis less original.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Final Project Selection and Key Areas of Exploration\nAfter considering the different proposed ideas, the team narrowed the options down to two: Tourism Dataset and World Happiness Report (WHR) Dataset. Ultimately, the team unanimously decided on the World Happiness Report (WHR) Analysis due to its novelty and the opportunity to explore and apply the various data visualization techniques learned in class effectively. Using this dataset, the group aims to develop an interactive visual analytics application using Shiny that will allow users to explore happiness trends in a comprehensive and dynamic manner.\n\n\nKey Areas of Exploration:\n\nImpact of Various Factors on Happiness: Analyze how economic, social, and governance-related factors contribute to happiness across different countries and regions.\nTemporal Trends in Happiness: Examine how happiness levels have changed over time from 2008 to 2024 and identify key global events that may have influenced these changes.\nSignificant Predictors of Happiness: Determine which variables have the strongest impact on a country’s happiness score and explore regional differences in their influence."
