    "section": "",
    "text": "Happiness is a key measure of societal well-being, influenced by both economic (e.g., GDP per capita) and non-economic factors (e.g., social support, freedom, and governance). However, understanding how these factors interact remains a challenge.\nThis project aims to analyze the strongest predictors of happiness using data from the World Happiness Report and develop an interactive visualization tool to explore these relationships. By making happiness data more accessible and insightful, this study supports evidence-based decision-making for policymakers and researchers seeking to enhance well-being worldwide."

The dataset includes economic, social, and governance-related factors that influence national well-being. The focus of this research is to analyze what constitutes a higher level of happiness across countries by identifying key contributing factors and their relationships."

Left-skewed, indicating some countries have very low happiness scores. GDP per Capita & Social Support:\nFollows a normal distribution, with most values around 1.0 - 1.5 for GDP. Social support has a strong right tail, meaning some countries have very high support. Freedom to Make Life Choices & Generosity:\nFreedom has a broad distribution but peaks around 0.6 - 0.7. Generosity is skewed left, meaning most values are quite low. Perceptions of Corruption:\nHighly skewed left, showing many countries perceive corruption as a major issue.\n\n-   Boxplots -- Comparison of happiness scores across regions\\\n-   Scatter Plots -- Relationships between key indicators and happiness\\\n\nCorrelation Analysis: Identifying the strongest relationships among factors.\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics('plots/correlation-heatmap.png')\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Insights: Happiness (Ladder Score) has the strongest correlations with:\n\nSocial Support (0.81) → Countries with stronger support systems are generally happier. GDP per Capita (0.77) → Wealthier countries tend to be happier. Healthy Life Expectancy (0.76) → Better health leads to higher happiness. Weak or Negative Correlations:\nGenerosity (0.13) and Perceptions of Corruption (0.45) have low influence on happiness. Dystopia + Residual (0.53) captures unexplained variance, slightly correlated.\nGeospatial Analysis: Mapping happiness scores across countries."
