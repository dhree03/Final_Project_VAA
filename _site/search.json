    "text": "Happiness is a key measure of societal well-being, influenced by both economic (e.g., GDP per capita) and non-economic factors (e.g., social support, freedom, and governance). However, understanding how these factors interact remains a challenge.\nThis project aims to analyze the strongest predictors of happiness using data from the World Happiness Report and develop an interactive visualization tool to explore these relationships. By making happiness data more accessible and insightful, this study supports evidence-based decision-making for policymakers and researchers seeking to enhance well-being worldwide."
