# 3. Agenda Item 1: Refining of Analysis Techniques

The team discussed and refined the analytical techniques to be applied in the project. The key components to be incorporated into the final analysis include:

-   **Time Series Analysis**: To analyze the temporal patterns of happiness scores and influencing factors.

-   **Multivariate Clustering**: To segment countries based on multiple happiness-related variables by years for a better understanding.

-   **Time Series Forecasting**: To predict future happiness trends based on historical patterns.

-   **Target Variable Prediction via Input Changes**: To allow users to simulate how changes in key variables (e.g., GDP, social support) may affect happiness scores.

-   **Penalized Regression (e.g., Ridge, LASSO)**: To handle multicollinearity issues and select relevant predictors for the final modeling.

Each member agreed on the relevance of these methods and committed to incorporating them into their respective analysis components.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Agenda Item 2: Finalizing of Dashboard Design

The team finalized the dashboard's visual structure, focusing on UI design, layout, and color scheme.

-   The overall structure will include the following sections:

    -   **Home Page**

    -   **Time Series Forecasting & Predictive Modeling**

    -   **Clustering (Time-series and Multivariate)**

    -   **Geospatial and Aspatial Analysis**

    -   **About**

-   The color scheme will be soft and professional, ensuring visual clarity without distracting users.

-   A consistent layout (yellow color scheme) will be used across all dashboards to maintain uniformity.

-   The team agreed to keep the UI user-friendly, with filters, sliders, and dropdowns for interactive exploration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Agenda Item 3: Updating of Individual Progress

Each member provided an update on their assigned components:

-   **Andrea** completed exploratory data analysis (EDA), generated initial geographical plots, and performed Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis.

-   **Dhreeti** performed time series forecasting and conducted time series analysis for trend identification.

-   **Yi Ming** performed preliminary EDA and explored suitable clustering techniques to apply in the multivariate clustering section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Agenda Item 4: Resolving of Bottlenecks

A critical issue was identified regarding data inconsistencies due to multiple exports of the cleaned dataset during collaborative work. Specifically, some columns contained unknown or corrupted values.

-   The problem was traced to the repeated execution of code chunks that exported the cleaned dataset to CSV.

-   The issue was resolved by:

    -   Setting the export code chunk to `eval: false` to prevent repeated overwriting.

    -   Creating a shared cleaned dataset saved in a separate folder as a "read-only" resource for all team members.

This solution ensured consistency across all subsequent analyses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Agenda Item 5: Setting of Final Deadlines

The team reached a consensus on the following timeline for deliverables:

| Deliverable             | Deadline   |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Combined Shiny App Code | 30/03/2025 |
| Poster Completion       | 31/03/2025 |
| UI Refinement           | 01/04/2025 |
| User Guide Completion   | 02/04/2025 |

This timeline allows for adequate buffer time before the final project submission on **April 5th**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With all discussion points addressed, the meeting was adjourned at 6:00 PM.
